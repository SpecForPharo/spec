After I realised that the Pharo board was not able to consider the concept of *copyright infringement*, and that stealing a project was far from an issue to them, I decided to give up and to give away the code since I do not want to fight with people not even understanding the pupose of the battle. So they won, they pushed me to not even wanting to take care of my own projects...
